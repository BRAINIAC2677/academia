  abstract={Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex visual understanding across scientific and reasoning tasks. While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.}

  abstract={As deep learning and machine learning architectures have demonstrated considerable promise in clinical diagnosis, establishing their reliability has become imperative for responsible medical implementations. This research examines uncertainty estimation techniques to improve model reliability in Parkinson’s disease detection. We assess Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Evidential Classification, and Bayesian Neural Networks across three datasets representing finger tapping, facial expressions, and vocal patterns. Findings indicate that Deep Evidential Classification performs poorly in both diagnostic accuracy and uncertainty assessment, whereas Monte Carlo Dropout and Bayesian Neural Networks exhibit enhanced dependability. Integrating uncertainty estimation enables identification of ambiguous predictions, minimizing diagnostic errors and promoting secure AI adoption in medicine.

  title={Document Layout Analysis on BaDLAD Dataset: A Comprehensive MViTv2 Based Approach},
  author={Khan, Ashrafur Rahman and Azad, Asif},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.16571},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving digital era, the analysis of document layouts plays a pivotal role in automated information extraction and interpretation. In our work, we have trained MViTv2 transformer model architecture with cascaded mask R-CNN on BaDLAD dataset to extract text box, paragraphs, images and tables from a document. After training on 20365 document images for 36 epochs in a 3 phase cycle, we achieved a training loss of 0.2125 and a mask loss of 0.19. Our work extends beyond training, delving into the exploration of potential enhancement avenues. We investigate the impact of rotation and flip augmentation, the effectiveness of slicing input images pre-inference, the implications of varying the resolution of the transformer backbone, and the potential of employing a dual-pass inference to uncover missed text-boxes. Through these explorations, we observe a spectrum of outcomes, where some modifications result in tangible performance improvements, while others offer unique insights for future endeavors.}

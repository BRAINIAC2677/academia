Hi ðŸ‘‹! My research is centered on building <u>Responsible and Trustworthy AI</u> for high-stakes domains like <u>Healthcare</u>. Alongside this, I am actively exploring the frontiers of <u>multimodal medical reasoning</u> and <u>agentic frameworks</u> to create more capable and reliable systems.

Currently, I am an <u>AI Research Engineer</u> with the AI Innovation Team at the Ministry of Defence, Saudi Arabia, contributing to AI-based autism diagnosis research in partnership with the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). Concurrently, I am collaborating with [Dr. Md Rizwan Parvez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KhC8rtcAAAAJ&hl=en), a Research Scientist at [QCRI](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/qcri), to investigate the reliability of state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models.

I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science & Engineering from the [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/) in March 2025. During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of working with esteemed mentors, including [Professor M Saifur Rahman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9d52x-cAAAAJ&hl=en) (BUET) and [Professor Ehsan Hoque](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZJrR0KQAAAAJ&hl=en) <u>(University of Rochester)</u>. Our work on making diagnostic machine learning models more robust was nominated for the <u>Best Paper Award</u> at the [AI in Healthcare (AIiH) 2025](https://aiih.cc/) conference.

In recognition of my academic excellence and leadership, I was named to the <u>Dean's List</u> for three consecutive years and honored as the sole recipient of the [IEEE Richard E. Merwin Scholarship](https://www.computer.org/volunteering/awards/scholarships/merwin/merwin-winners) from Bangladesh for Fall 2023.

<u>I am open to PhD opportunities for Fall 2026 ðŸŽ“</u>
